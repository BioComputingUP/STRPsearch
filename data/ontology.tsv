0	Tandem Repeat proteins		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tandem_repeats
1	Crystalline aggregates	Crystalline aggregates formed by regions with 1 or 2 residue long repeats
1.1	Alpha-helical crystalline aggregates	Poly-A alpha-helices form an hexagonal crystal structure.
1.2	Beta-rippled crystalline aggregates	Stacking of beta-rippled layers formed by polyglycine chains in an extended conformation generated by the alternation of two mirror-symmetrical residual conformations along the chain.
2	Fibrous repeats	Fibrous structures stabilized by interchain interactions
2.1	Collagen triple-helix	Collagens are the most abundant human proteins, have a tripeptide repeat Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are any residues but are usually proline or hydroxyproline. The collagen chains have an extended polyproline II conformation and assemble into a triple helix.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen
2.2	Alpha helical coiled coil	The -helical coiled coils are characterized by a heptad repeat (abcdefg)n in which hydrophobic residues are located at positions a and d and, in general, polar residues are located elsewhere. They form oligomers of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 chains. Each chain folds into an a-helix that is wrapped around the axis of the coiled coil structure.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coiled_coil
3	Elongated repeats	Elongated structures whose repeat units require one another to maintain structure	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid_protein_domain
3.1	Beta-solenoid	The beta‐solenoid structures are characterized by solenoidal windings of the polypeptide chain having exclusively ‐strands as the secondary structure elements. A typical shape represents a rigid rod. The repeating unit is an individual coil of the solenoid which consists of 12–30 amino acids configured as 2, 3, or 4 b‐strands, together with connecting turns. Each coil in the solenoid has an axial rise of about 0.48 nm.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_solenoid
3.2	Alpha/beta solenoid	The alpha/beta-solenoid structures are characterized by solenoidal windings of the polypeptide chain having both ‐strands and alpha-helices as the secondary structure elements. The repeating unit has size of 20–30 amino acids. One of the most known representatives are LRR proteins, having curved shapes.
3.3	Alpha-solenoid	The alpha‐solenoid structures are characterized by solenoidal windings of the polypeptide chain having exclusively alpha-helices as the secondary structure elements. The repeating unit is an individual coil of the solenoid, which consists of 30-45 amino acids configured as 2, 3, or 4 alpha‐helices together with connecting turns. These structures have a variety of twisted- curved shapes.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_solenoid
3.4	Beta hairpins	A non-solenoidal repetitive structures consisting of tandem arrays of beta- hairpins. These type of proteins include a variety of elongated folds including: triple beta-spirals, trimeric cross-beta-prisms, single-layer antiparallel beta-structures (straight and curved), beta- hairpin stacks with coordinated zinc ions, spiral beta-hairpin staircases and beta- burrito structures.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_hairpin
3.6	Box	Box-shaped elongated structure.
4	Closed repeats	Closed structures whose repeat units need one another to maintain structure	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroid_repeat_proteins
4.1	TIM-barrel	TIM barrels are formed by eight units composed of an alpha-helix and a beta-strand, arranged in a circular structure; the eight beta-strands join together to form a beta-sheet that is the inner part of the barrel and the alpha-helices pack against each other on the outside.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIM_barrel
4.2	Beta-barrel / beta hairpins	These structures are formed by beta- hairpin repeats and have a so-called up-and-down beta-barrel fold. Each of the beta-strands are hydrogen-bonded to the strands immediately before and after it in the sequence and the first strand is hydrogen-bonded to the last one.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_barrel
4.3	Beta-trefoil	The beta-trefoil structures are characterized by six beta-harpins, three of them form a triangular prism structure and the other three form a cap on this prism; One pair of these beta-harpins represents a repetitive unit in the structure, which may not be immediately apparent in the sequence.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_trefoil_fold
4.4	Propeller	The beta-propeller are formed by 4 to 8 repeats; composed by four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, arranged in the shape of a blade around a central axis. These are closed structures with interactions between the N- and C-terminal repeats. The alpha/beta-propeller structures are composed of 4 to 8 three/four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, mostly parallel to the central axis. Each one of the beta-sheets domains may contain or be followed by a short alpha-helix, peripheral to the structure, with no critical structural role. Like the beta-propeller, the structures are closed by hydrophobic interactions between the N- and C-terminal repeats.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-propeller
4.5	Alpha/beta prism	The alpha/beta prism structures have a triangular cross-section; Each side of the prism contains a repeat, composed by a pair of alpha-helices and a three- stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The alpha-helices are located inside the structure and the beta-sheets are located mostly outside.
4.6	Alpha-barrel	The alpha-barrel structures are composed exclusively by alpha-helices as the secondary structure elements, with each repeat composed of one alpha-helical hairpin. The overall structures have circular cross-sections.
4.7	Alpha/beta barrel	This barrel is formed by units composed of a short alpha-helix followed by a beta-hairpin, followed by an alpha-helix and a beta-strand. The beta-hairpin from one unit and the beta-strand from the other unit form a beta-sheet that runs parallel to the barrel axis.
4.9	Alpha/beta trefoil	The alpha/beta trefoil structures are formed by the same double-stranded beta-harpins as the beta-trefoils, with some peripheral alpha-helices, accessories to the structure. Instead of the triangular shape visible in the beta-trefoils, its beta-sheets are wrapped around a circular cross-section.
4.10	Aligned prism	A repetitive unit of about 45-55 residues has four-stranded antiparallel beta-structure. Three repeats form a prism with 3-fold symmetry. The beta-strands are aligned along the symmetry axis.
5	Beads-on-a-string	Beads on a string structures whose repeat units are in tandem and large enough to fold independently
5.1	Alpha-beads	This topology has structures with alpha- helical globular domains as repetitive units (beads).
5.2	Beta-beads	This topology has structures with beta- structural globular domains as repetitive units (beads).
5.3	Alpha/beta-beads	This topology has structures with alpha/beta-globular domains as repetitive units (beads).

5.5	Alpha/beta sandwich beads	This topology has structures with alpha/beta-sandwich domains as repetitive units.
